<h2>Infrastructures</h2>
<p>
Basic public facilities are the foundations of an economy. Roads, bridges, and railways that connect; <br>
seaports and airports that serve as gateways to the world; and, water distribution systems and dams that harness water for irrigation <br>
and power generation are all vital towards development and progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
 SLI Construction Company has moved decisively to be involved in building such structures and components of systems<br>
 that provide services that are needed by society. It has effectively developed its competencies to construct such vital infrastructure.<br>
 Throughout the years, SLI has built several bridges and hundreds of kilometers of national highways throughout the Philippines. <br>
The EDSA Metro Rail Transit (MRT) Project, along Metro Manila's most important <br>
road artery is a prime example of EEIâ€™s expertise in infrastructure.<br>
<br>
<br>
SLI was a major player in the construction of the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, the South Luzon Expressway,<br>
 the NAIA III Flyovers, the New Iloilo Airport, the Casecnan Irrigation Project, <br>
 the Kamanava Flood Control and Bohol Irrigation Projects, and the LRT Line 1 Expansion Project.<br>
As the Philippines continues to build the necessary structures that contribute to economic progress,<br>
 SLI offers the same world-class capability that has made it one of the country's leading construction companies.<br>
